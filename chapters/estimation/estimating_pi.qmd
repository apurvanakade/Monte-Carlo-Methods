We'll start with a standard application of Monte Carlo methods: estimating the value of $\pi$.


The area of a circle is given by $A = \pi r^2$. The area of a square that circumscribes the circle is given by $4r^2$. The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square is $\pi/4$.

If we randomly select $N$ points in the square, the fraction of points that fall inside the circle will be equal to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. We can use this fact to estimate the value of $\pi.$

```{python}
#| label: fig-estimate-pi
#| fig-cap: "Estimating pi by randomly selecting points in the square"
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

seed = 0          # seed for the random number generator
r = 1             # radius of the circle
N = 1000          # number of random points

np.random.seed(seed)

# generate n random points in the square [-r, r] x [-r, r]
X = np.random.uniform(-r, r, N)
Y = np.random.uniform(-r, r, N)

# select points inside the circle
I = np.where(X**2 + Y**2 < r**2, "r", "b")

# draw the circle
theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100) 
plt.plot(r*np.cos(theta), r*np.sin(theta), 'k-')

# draw the square 
plt.plot([-r, -r, r, r, -r], [-r, r, r, -r, -r], 'k-')

# plot the points
plt.scatter(X, Y, c=I, s=1)

# count the number of points inside the circle
n_in = np.sum(I == "r")

# estimate the value of pi
pi = 4*n_in/N

# print the estimate of pi
plt.title(f"Estimated value of pi: {pi}")

# set the aspect of the plot to be equal
plt.axis('equal')

plt.show()
```

## Questions

- How accurate is this estimate of $\pi$ in terms of $N$?
- Can we improve the estimate by choosing a different sampling technique (other than uniformly sampling on the square)?
