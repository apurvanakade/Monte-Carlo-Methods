## Introduction

What are Monte Carlo methods?


Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: 


- numerical integration and estimation,

- simulating physical and mathematical systems,

- optimization.

A typical application of MC consists of

1. Forming a mathematical model for a real world system, usually involving some random variables.
2. Determining the distribution of the random variables, either completely or partially.
3. Generating samples from the proposed distribution to run simulations.
4. Compare results from simulated data with real world observations to update the model.
