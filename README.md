Converted chapters to Quarto, but some still rough around the edges. 7 Gibbs Sampling `model` is not defined in the code 12 Bootstrapping `skew` is not defined in the code 13 Hidden Markov Models is only code with no exposition Also some extra notebooks that were not included but maybe should be 8 contains 'Gibbs proof' and 'Remarks' notebooks 10 Variance Reduction has some extras 11 Var Reduction Continued has 'simpy' and 'test' 12 Optimization should 'scratch' be included or not?
